Yesterday when I was young Yesterday when I was young
昨日年少时
The taste of life was sweet like rain upon my tongue
生命的滋味甜美，有如舌尖上的雨珠
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
我嬉游人生，当它是个愚蠢的游戏
The way an evening breeze would tease a candle flame
就像晚风逗弄烛火那样
The thousand dreams I dreamed
我做过的一千个梦
The splendid things I planned
还有那些我所计划的大业
I always built，alas，on weak and shifting sand
唉，总是建在松软的流沙上
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
我以夜为日，远离白天明晃晃的阳光
And only now I see how the years have run away
直到现在，才知道当年岁月是如何流逝的
